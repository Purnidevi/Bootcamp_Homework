    <p>How to Make Rava Ladoo ?</p>
    <div>Heat a pan and add the rava, reduce flame and roast the rava until a nice aroma wafts. Make sure to not change the rava color and roast evenly. To ensure this, keep stirring continuously.
        Cool down and grind it into a very fine powder using mixer. (If you are making in bulk, you can grind in mill).
        Powder the sugar into a very fine powder as well, along with cardamom.
        Transfer the powdered rava and sugar to a large bowl. (If you want you can sieve both to get a smooth finish ladoo).
        Fry broken cashews in the ghee and add these to the rava and sugar mixture.
        Mix thoroughly. First you can use a ladle to mix as the ghee will be hot. Wait until it is warm enough to handle.
        Make small balls out of this mixture immediately, roll it tight, If you could not roll and the mixture is too dry, add more warm ghee to it and make balls again.</div>
